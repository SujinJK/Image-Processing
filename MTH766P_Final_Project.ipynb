It is your responsibility to ensure that the code produces **no errors**. Contrary to the in-term assessments, I will not try to fix any errors when assessing your work because you have several weeks to develop this project. Instead, you will receive **zero marks for any exercises where the code cell raises an error**. If you run into an error and do not know how to fix it, comment out the critical line of code and any subsequent ones that depend on it. Add a remark indicating that you are aware of the problem and potential reasons.\n",

    "\n",
    "As indicated in the exercise headings below, roughly **20 % of the marks** for each coding exercise will be awarded for **coding style**. This includes the use of appropriate variable names, suitable comments to explain complex sequences of operations, and docstrings for functions.\n",
